SensorDefinitionAPI (DRAFT)
===========================

An API for defining Sensors. We define both data about the physical sensor itself, and MetaData about the information the Sensor delivers.

This is a draft document. We welcome feedback, criticisms and suggestions. Currently the best place to do that is on this GitHub Page.

You can view the definition in it's raw form in apiary.apib, or beautifully rendered by Apiary:
